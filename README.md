# AuctionHouse

A web app, built using Meteor, to run an auction digitally, primarily designed for non-profit/charity organisations to run fundraisers.

This is a work in progress, and isn't production ready yet.

##### Set up

1. Install Meteor `$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
2. Clone auction from Github.
3. Run 'meteor' in the directory from then on to start it up. It will take longer on the first pass to install the various packages.

Any of these commands may need to be run as super user, depending on your system.

##### Things to improve

* See the [issues](https://github.com/simonpfry/AuctionHouse/issues).
